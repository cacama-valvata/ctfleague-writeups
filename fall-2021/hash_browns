First off, we are directed to a website http://chal.ctf-league.osusec.org:31337/. When we get there, we are greeted with an explanation of password hashing and a login screen. The “submit” button for the login is shaking and we are suggested to inspect it. Upon inspection, we see that upon submitting, the login form calls a function “check_password().” There is a JS file attached to the page but the function we are looking for is actually in its own <script> tags at the bottom of the HTML. 

The function performs a SHA-256 hash on the password, and if they match, shows the true page to the user. This hash is b0fef621727ff82a7d334d9f1f047dc662ed0e27e05aa8fd1aefd19b0fff312c. A great thing about hashes like these are that the hashed password is often just on the internet to reverse-search. So we plug that hash into google and the result is “pineapple.” We put this password into the webpage and voila!

Instead of trying to catch the dancing flag, we can just inspect the webpage again and copy it from the code: osu{p1n34ppl3_h45h_Br0wN5_4r3_g00D}
